<div>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to control the layout and appearance of HTML elements on a web page. It allows developers to define styles for elements such as colors, fonts, spacir positioning, and more. CSS can be written inline within HTML, embedded in the <style> tag, or linked externally in a separate file. By separating content (HTML) from presentation (CSS), it makes web design more efficient and maintainable.CSS also enables responsive design, ensuring websites look great across different devices and screen sizes.
